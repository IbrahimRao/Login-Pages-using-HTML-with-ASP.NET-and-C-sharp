# Login-Pages-with-Database-Connection

This repository showcases a comprehensive example of creating login pages and seamlessly connecting them to a Microsoft SQL database using the ASP.NET framework. With this project, you'll learn how to build a secure and functional login system for your web applications. 

# Overview
A secure and user-friendly login system is a critical component of many web applications. This project demonstrates the creation of login pages with HTML and their integration with a Microsoft SQL database using the ASP.NET framework. The system is designed to authenticate users and grant them access to protected resources while maintaining data integrity and security.

# Prerequisites
Before you can run this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- ASP.NET Development Environment: Set up a development environment for ASP.NET, such as Visual Studio.
- Microsoft SQL Server: Install and configure Microsoft SQL Server or use a cloud-hosted SQL database.
- HTML Knowledge: Basic knowledge of HTML is helpful to understand and customize the login pages.
- C# Knowledge: Familiarity with C# is beneficial for ASP.NET development.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. Set Up SQL Database: If you're using a local SQL Server instance, create the necessary database tables for user information and authentication. If you're using a cloud-hosted database, make sure you have the connection details handy.

3. Open the Project: Use your preferred development environment to open the ASP.NET project.

4. Configure Database Connection: Update the connection string in the project to point to your SQL database. Ensure that the database server, username, and password are correctly configured.

5. Customize the Login Pages: The project contains HTML files for login and registration pages. Customize these pages according to your branding and design preferences.

6. Run the Application: Build and run the ASP.NET application. Access the login page in your browser to test the login and registration processes.

7. Database Interaction: Verify that user registration and login information is correctly stored and retrieved from the SQL database.

Code Structure
The code structure of the project includes:

- ASP.NET controllers for handling user registration and login logic.
- HTML files for login and registration pages, which include forms for user input.
- A connection to the SQL database through a connection string in the configuration.
- Secure password storage and authentication procedures.

# Database Integration
The project demonstrates how to connect to a Microsoft SQL database for user management. It includes tables for storing user information, including usernames and hashed passwords, as well as mechanisms for securely handling user authentication.
